a bear with a sore head a bit of a dark horse
a bitter pill to swallow a different kettle of fish a dog's life
a fish out of water a long shot
a memory like a sieve a night owl
a pain in the neck a piece of cake
a red rag to a bull a red-letter day
a sitting duck
a storm in a teacup a wild-goose chase above board Achilles heel against all odds agree to disagree 
all along
all but all in  all in all
all the same all told
an old wives' tale
an unknown quantity as a last resort
as the crow flies at close quarters at large
at the cutting edge bark up the wrong tree be ahead of one's time be all at sea

be in sb's black books be in sb's shoes
be in the dark about sth be in the doghouse
be in the know
be in the same boat
be in two minds about sth be on the cards
be on the defensive be on the up and up be out of practice be over the moon





be second to none be sound asleep
be the apple of sb's eye be the perfect image of sb
be the splitting image of sb be thrown off balance
be tickled pink be up and about be up in arms be worn out
beget soaked to the skin behave a close shave bear fruit
beat aboutaround the bush beat sb black and blue
before one can say Jack Robinson beg the question
behind bars behind the scenes below the belt bide one's time big cheese
big-headed
bite off more than sb can chew black and blue all over
black tie blaze a trail
blessing in disguise blow a fuse
blue-eyed boy bolt from the blue brainwave
break even break the ice
bring sth home to sb bring to one's knees browned off
bury one's head in the sand butter sb up
by and large by definition
by force of habit by trial and error call it quits
call sb names cast aspersions
catch sb red-handed chair a meeting
chip off the old block chop and change claim to fame
clear the air come clean
come out of one's shell come to a head
come to a standstill come to terms with come to the fore come to the point cook one's goose cost a 
bomb
cost an arm and a leg





cramp one's style crocodile tears cross one's mind cry over spilt milk cut corners
cut sb dead
cut sb to the quick cut to the bone deal a blow to
different as chalk and cheese does it show
dog eat dog dog-eared
don't give up your day job don't hold your breath donkey work
donkey's years down in the dumps down the drain drive a hard bargain drive sb up the wall drop a 
brick
drop sb a line ease off
eat one's heart out every nook and cranny face the music
fair and square
fall head over heels fall into place
feel down in the mouth feel in one's bones
feel one's ears burning few and far between fight like cat and dog fine kettle of fish
flat broke
flog a dead horse fly off the handle fly on the wall for all
for all I care for all I know
for donkey's years for the time being frosty welcome gatecrasher

in a nutshell in a rut
in a tick
in abeyance in arrears

keep one's fingers crossed keep one's wits about one keep oneself to oneself keep sth quiet
keep sth under one's hat keep up with the Joneses kick the bucket
kill time
kill two birds with one stone know the ropes
lay bare
lay the table lend an ear lend sb a hand
let sleeping dogs lie
let the cat out of the bag like a bull in a china shop like the back of one's hand like water off a 
duck's back live out of a suitcase
look at sth though rose-coloured sp look down one's nose at sb

moon around
more to sb than meets the eye mutton dressed as a lamb
no room to swing a cat no wonder
not all it's cracked up to be not be one's cup of tea
not count one's chickens before the not have it both ways
not have the foggiest idea not hold water
not lose any sleep over sth null and void
of all people
of its own accord of no consequence off colour
off the cuff off the point off the record
on a shoe string on account of on edge
on no account
on second thoughts on the air
on the alert on the ball on the blink on the dole on the dot
on the face of it on the level
on the quiet
on the spur of the moment on thisthat account
once and for all once in a blue moon
one's flesh and blood open to debate

strike gold sweet tooth swim like a fish take it easy take one's time
take sb for granted take sth into account take sth on the chin take sth to heart
take sth with a pinch of salt take the bull by the horns take things to pieces
take to one's heels
talk the hind legs off a donkey the black sheep of the family the ins and outs
the last straw
the life and soul of sth the lion's share
the pot calling the kettle black





the rat race
the tip of the iceberg the year dot
thick-skinned
through thick and thin throw a party
to no effect tongue in cheek tooth and nail touch and go
turn a blind eye to sth turn over a new leaf under the weather
until one is blue in the face until the cows come home up and coming
up in the air ups and downs
wash sb's hands of sb wet behind the ears wet blanket
whet sb's appetite white elephant white-collar job
with a view to doing sth with flying colours without fail
work a miracle work to rule
