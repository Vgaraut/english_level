2
00:04:55,183 --> 00:04:58,310
What are you doing?
We don't stop here.

3
00:05:10,448 --> 00:05:12,699
Get out of the car.

4
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:54,880
The boys found this...

5
00:08:54,964 --> 00:08:57,799
on the floor, in back of the Caddy.

6
00:08:57,884 --> 00:09:00,427
Yeah.
You showed me.

7
00:09:02,221 --> 00:09:06,058
- Could be unrelated.
- Could be.

8
00:09:07,101 --> 00:09:10,354
Any of those dead kids
wearing pearl earrings?

9
00:09:10,438 --> 00:09:13,065
No.

10
00:09:13,149 --> 00:09:16,485
Could be someone's
missing, maybe.

11
00:09:17,779 --> 00:09:20,113
That's what I'm thinking.

12
00:09:57,527 --> 00:10:00,153
Just one more bag after that.

13
00:11:45,843 --> 00:11:48,345
I just wanted to come here.

14
00:11:49,096 --> 00:11:50,430
To Winkie's?

15
00:11:51,933 --> 00:11:53,725
This Winkie's.

16
00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:58,438
Okay. Why this Winkie's?

17
00:12:02,109 --> 00:12:03,902
It's kind of embarrassing.

18
00:12:06,948 --> 00:12:08,615
Go ahead.

19
00:12:10,201 --> 00:12:12,202
I had a dream about this place.

20
00:12:12,286 --> 00:12:13,870
Oh, boy.

21
00:12:13,955 --> 00:12:15,956
See what I mean?

22
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:19,209
Okay.

23
00:12:19,293 --> 00:12:21,670
So you had a dream about this place.

24
00:12:22,964 --> 00:12:24,422
Tell me.

25
00:12:28,511 --> 00:12:31,680
Well –

26
00:12:31,764 --> 00:12:33,890
it's the second one I've had.

27
00:12:33,975 --> 00:12:35,934
But they're both the same.

28
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:39,896
They start out that I'm in here...

29
00:12:39,981 --> 00:12:43,191
but it's not day or night.

30
00:12:44,277 --> 00:12:47,487
I-It's kind of half night, you know?

31
00:12:47,572 --> 00:12:50,323
But it looks just like this.

32
00:12:50,408 --> 00:12:52,325
Except for the light.

33
00:12:53,744 --> 00:12:56,329
And I'm scared like I can't tell ya.

34
00:12:58,124 --> 00:13:01,042
Of all people...

35
00:13:01,127 --> 00:13:03,044
you're standing right over there...

36
00:13:07,842 --> 00:13:09,801
by that counter.

37
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:15,265
You're in both dreams, and you're scared.

38
00:13:17,435 --> 00:13:20,854
I get even more frightened
when I see how afraid you are, and...

39
00:13:24,817 --> 00:13:26,860
then I realize what it is.

40
00:13:30,865 --> 00:13:32,365
There's a man...

41
00:13:34,118 --> 00:13:36,244
in back of this place.

42
00:13:38,039 --> 00:13:40,624
He's the one who's doing it.

43
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:44,794
I can see him through the wall.

44
00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:47,631
I can see his face.

45
00:13:53,763 --> 00:13:56,222
I hope that I never see that face...

46
00:13:56,307 --> 00:13:58,850
ever outside of a dream.

47
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:11,154
That's it.

48
00:14:11,238 --> 00:14:12,947
So...

49
00:14:13,032 --> 00:14:15,909
you came to see if he's out there.

50
00:14:18,913 --> 00:14:21,498
To get rid of this god-awful feeling.

51
00:14:25,002 --> 00:14:26,586
Right, then.

52
00:14:45,398 --> 00:14:46,940
Oh –

53
00:15:13,926 --> 00:15:15,844
It was around here.

54
00:16:24,497 --> 00:16:28,708
Dan! Dan, you all right? Dan!

55
00:16:29,752 --> 00:16:32,170
Dan!

56
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,737
Hello?

57
00:16:59,782 --> 00:17:02,408
The girl is still missing.

58
00:17:23,597 --> 00:17:25,014
Talk to me.

59
00:17:25,099 --> 00:17:27,016
The same.

60
00:18:03,137 --> 00:18:05,054
Oh!

61
00:18:05,139 --> 00:18:07,140
I can't believe it.

62
00:18:37,421 --> 00:18:40,924
Well, it's time to say good-bye, Betty.

63
00:18:41,008 --> 00:18:42,926
It's been so nice traveling with you.

64
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:46,095
Thank you, Irene.
I was so excited and nervous.

65
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:48,097
It was sure great to have you to talk to.

66
00:18:48,182 --> 00:18:50,600
Remember, I'll be watching
for you on the big screen.

67
00:18:50,684 --> 00:18:54,270
Okay, Irene. Won't that be the day?

68
00:18:54,355 --> 00:18:57,523
Good luck, Betty dear.

69
00:18:57,608 --> 00:19:00,318
Take care of yourself.
And be careful.

70
00:19:00,402 --> 00:19:04,113
- I will. Thanks again.
- Okay, dear.

71
00:19:04,198 --> 00:19:07,200
Betty, it was so nice meeting you.
All the luck in the world.

72
00:19:07,284 --> 00:19:09,035
Thank you.

73
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:11,204
- Bye.
- Bye.

74
00:19:17,878 --> 00:19:19,796
My bags!

75
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,381
Where to?

76
00:19:22,716 --> 00:19:24,717
1612 Havenhurst.

77
00:19:27,554 --> 00:19:29,472
Got it.

78
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:48,468
Ten bucks says you're Betty.

79
00:20:48,552 --> 00:20:51,220
Yes, I am, Mrs. Lenoix.

80
00:20:51,305 --> 00:20:53,222
It is Mrs. Lenoix, isn't it?

81
00:20:53,307 --> 00:20:55,558
Oh, in all my living glory, baby.

82
00:20:55,642 --> 00:20:57,602
Pleased to meet you.

83
00:20:57,686 --> 00:21:00,563
Oh, just call me Coco.
Everybody else does.

84
00:21:00,647 --> 00:21:04,108
- Wait there, and I'll go get the key.
- Okay, Coco.

85
00:21:08,697 --> 00:21:11,866
Wilkins! Wilkins!

86
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:15,870
If that damn dog
craps in the courtyard one more time...

87
00:21:15,954 --> 00:21:19,373
I'm just gonna
bake his little butt for breakfast!

88
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:21,793
- You don't have any pets, do you?
- Oh, no, I don't.

89
00:21:21,877 --> 00:21:25,296
Well, they're allowed. I just don't
like them here for obvious reasons.

90
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:27,924
You know, there was a man
that lived here once...

91
00:21:28,008 --> 00:21:30,676
that had a prizefighting kangaroo.

92
00:21:30,761 --> 00:21:33,054
Well, you just wouldn't believe...

93
00:21:33,138 --> 00:21:36,057
what that kangaroo did to this courtyard.

94
00:21:37,184 --> 00:21:40,228
Let's go see your aunt's apartment.
It's a good one.

95
00:21:40,312 --> 00:21:42,438
I can hardly wait.

96
00:21:49,571 --> 00:21:51,114
It's unbelievable!

97
00:21:51,198 --> 00:21:55,159
- I told ya.
- Oh, wow!

98
00:21:55,244 --> 00:21:59,372
Well, you and your aunt probably have
an understanding, so here's the key.

99
00:21:59,456 --> 00:22:02,166
- And if you need anything, just give a holler.
- Okay.

100
00:22:02,251 --> 00:22:05,253
You know, everybody in this building
is pretty much okay with me...

101
00:22:05,337 --> 00:22:06,838
or they wouldn't be here.

102
00:22:06,922 --> 00:22:08,381
Oh.

103
00:22:08,465 --> 00:22:11,759
If you like, later on
I'll introduce you around.

104
00:22:11,844 --> 00:22:14,554
Well, no hard feelings if you don't.

105
00:23:40,474 --> 00:23:44,143
Oh, my. I-I'm sorry. My Aunt Ruth didn't
tell me someone was gonna be here.

106
00:23:44,228 --> 00:23:47,563
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.

107
00:23:47,648 --> 00:23:49,857
I'm Ruth's niece. My name's Betty.

108
00:23:49,942 --> 00:23:52,652
I-I'm sure she told you I was coming.

109
00:23:53,695 --> 00:23:55,613
There was an accident.

110
00:23:55,697 --> 00:23:57,782
I came here.

111
00:23:57,866 --> 00:24:00,409
I understand. I saw the dress.

112
00:24:00,494 --> 00:24:04,288
I'm sorry. Are you all right?

113
00:24:04,373 --> 00:24:06,332
What happened?

114
00:24:07,584 --> 00:24:10,169
A car –

115
00:24:10,254 --> 00:24:12,338
A car accident.

116
00:24:12,422 --> 00:24:14,340
Oh.

117
00:24:14,424 --> 00:24:16,425
Are you okay?

118
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,138
I think so.

119
00:24:21,223 --> 00:24:23,683
I was just...

120
00:24:23,767 --> 00:24:25,685
taking a shower.

121
00:24:25,769 --> 00:24:27,687
Oh, my God. I'm – I'm sorry.

122
00:24:27,771 --> 00:24:31,023
I'll let you get back to that.
I'm gonna get unpacked.

123
00:24:35,696 --> 00:24:37,655
What's your name?

124
00:24:41,368 --> 00:24:45,621
I'm – I'm sorry. I'll get out of here,
and we can talk later.

125
00:25:22,242 --> 00:25:25,911
My name's... Rita.

126
00:25:25,996 --> 00:25:28,164
Hi.

127
00:25:28,248 --> 00:25:30,207
Do you work with my aunt?

128
00:25:31,835 --> 00:25:34,378
- No, I –
- I-I'm sorry.

129
00:25:34,463 --> 00:25:38,049
It's – It's none of my business. I –

130
00:25:41,803 --> 00:25:43,721
She has pretty red hair.

131
00:25:43,805 --> 00:25:47,850
She's letting me stay here while she's working
on a movie that's being made in Canada.

132
00:25:47,934 --> 00:25:50,436
But... I guess you already know that.

133
00:25:51,813 --> 00:25:54,190
I couldn't afford a place
like this in a million years.

134
00:25:54,274 --> 00:25:58,319
Unless, of course, I'm discovered
and become a movie star.

135
00:25:58,403 --> 00:26:01,614
Of course, I'd rather be known
as a great actress than a movie star.

136
00:26:01,698 --> 00:26:04,033
But, you know, sometimes
people end up being both.

137
00:26:04,117 --> 00:26:08,621
So that is, I guess you'd say,
sort of why I came here.

138
00:26:12,292 --> 00:26:15,961
I'm sorry. I'm just so excited to be here.

139
00:26:16,046 --> 00:26:18,547
I mean, I just came here
from Deep River, Ontario...

140
00:26:18,632 --> 00:26:20,716
and now I'm in this...

141
00:26:21,468 --> 00:26:23,344
dream place.

142
00:26:23,428 --> 00:26:25,638
Well, you can imagine how I feel.

143
00:26:30,769 --> 00:26:32,144
Oh.

144
00:26:32,229 --> 00:26:34,897
What – Sit down.

145
00:26:39,736 --> 00:26:41,654
Wh-Where were you hurt?

146
00:26:44,241 --> 00:26:46,242
- Oh, we should call a doctor.
- No.

147
00:26:46,326 --> 00:26:48,911
- But this could be serious.
- No, I –

148
00:26:48,995 --> 00:26:50,913
I need to sleep.

149
00:26:50,997 --> 00:26:53,207
If you have a concussion,
you shouldn't sleep.

150
00:26:53,291 --> 00:26:56,001
It will be okay if I sleep.

151
00:26:56,086 --> 00:26:59,505
I just need to lie down here and sleep.

152
00:27:57,105 --> 00:28:00,900
You see, Adam,
there are some suggestions...

153
00:28:00,984 --> 00:28:03,110
that are to be brought forward.

154
00:28:03,195 --> 00:28:06,280
I know you said you would
entertain suggestions.

155
00:28:06,364 --> 00:28:09,575
And that's all anybody here
is asking you to do.

156
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:12,786
What are you talking about?

157
00:28:12,871 --> 00:28:15,414
An open mind.

158
00:28:15,499 --> 00:28:18,709
You're in the process
of recasting your lead actress...

159
00:28:18,793 --> 00:28:20,753
and I'm –

160
00:28:21,421 --> 00:28:24,965
We're asking you to keep an open mind.

161
00:28:35,519 --> 00:28:37,520
What was it last time?

162
00:28:39,606 --> 00:28:42,942
Okay. Let's try the next one.

163
00:28:43,026 --> 00:28:45,486
He's not gonna like it.

164
00:28:45,570 --> 00:28:48,781
We'll see.

165
00:28:53,328 --> 00:28:56,372
Ah, the Castigliane brothers.

166
00:28:56,456 --> 00:28:58,374
Let me introduce you around.

167
00:28:59,834 --> 00:29:03,254
Oh, please, uh, just take a seat.

168
00:29:03,338 --> 00:29:05,548
This is Mr. Darby, whom you know...

169
00:29:05,632 --> 00:29:09,218
and this is the director, Adam Kesher...

170
00:29:09,302 --> 00:29:12,513
and his, uh, manager, Robert Smith.

171
00:29:45,297 --> 00:29:47,590
Oh, yeah.

172
00:29:47,674 --> 00:29:49,592
- She's very pretty.
- Mm-hmm.

173
00:29:49,676 --> 00:29:54,638
- Mmm. Mmm.
- May I offer you gentlemen... anything?

174
00:29:56,808 --> 00:29:59,435
- Espresso.
- Nothin'.

175
00:29:59,519 --> 00:30:01,895
Uh, what's the photo for?

176
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:04,565
One espresso.

177
00:30:04,649 --> 00:30:06,900
No, that's it.

178
00:30:06,985 --> 00:30:09,194
I think you're going to enjoy
your espresso this time.

179
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:12,948
I've done quite a bit of research,
knowing how hard you are to please.

180
00:30:13,033 --> 00:30:15,618
This one comes highly recommended.

181
00:30:15,702 --> 00:30:17,786
What's the photo for?

182
00:30:17,871 --> 00:30:19,997
It's a recommendation.

183
00:30:21,082 --> 00:30:23,876
A recommendation to you, Adam.

184
00:30:25,253 --> 00:30:28,505
- It's not a recommendation.
- This is the girl.

185
00:30:29,215 --> 00:30:33,052
What girl? For what?
What is this, Ray?

186
00:30:33,136 --> 00:30:36,722
Uh, we'd be happy to put her
on the list for considerations.

187
00:30:36,806 --> 00:30:38,891
Uh, you'd be pleased to know...

188
00:30:38,975 --> 00:30:42,227
that there's quite a bit
of interest in this role.

189
00:30:43,313 --> 00:30:45,564
Interest? No, no.

190
00:30:45,649 --> 00:30:47,566
There's six of the top actresses
that want this thing.

191
00:30:47,651 --> 00:30:50,027
This is the girl.

192
00:30:50,111 --> 00:30:53,155
- Ryan, take care of this.
- Hold on. Hold on, Adam.

193
00:30:53,239 --> 00:30:55,157
Hold on?

194
00:30:55,241 --> 00:30:57,701
There's no way. There's no way!

195
00:31:12,967 --> 00:31:15,719
Napkin.

196
00:31:15,804 --> 00:31:19,181
- Pardon?
- Napkin.

197
00:31:19,265 --> 00:31:21,850
Of course.

198
00:31:21,935 --> 00:31:23,894
Excuse me.

199
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:42,538
Is that all, sir?

200
00:32:39,512 --> 00:32:42,556
- Shit.
- I'm sorry.

201
00:32:42,682 --> 00:32:45,851
-That was a highly recommended –
-That is considered one of
the finest espressos in the world.

202
00:32:45,935 --> 00:32:49,605
What is going on here?
There is no way that girl is in my movie!

203
00:32:53,193 --> 00:32:54,818
This is the girl.

204
00:32:54,903 --> 00:32:58,363
Hey, that girl is not in my film!

205
00:32:59,616 --> 00:33:03,619
It's no longer your film.

206
00:33:08,625 --> 00:33:10,542
This is the girl.

207
00:33:49,582 --> 00:33:51,500
Castigliane brothers
get out of that limo?

208
00:33:53,127 --> 00:33:55,420
- You mean two guys in dark suits?
- Yeah.

209
00:33:55,505 --> 00:33:58,090
- Yeah.
- Leave that door open.

210
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,518
Castigliane brothers?

211
00:34:09,602 --> 00:34:13,730
- Beat it, pal.
- Okay.

212
00:34:56,858 --> 00:34:58,817
Good afternoon, Mr. Roque.

213
00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:05,240
Her name is Camilla Rhodes.

214
00:35:05,325 --> 00:35:08,410
The director doesn't want her.

215
00:35:11,331 --> 00:35:14,291
Do you want him replaced?

216
00:35:16,711 --> 00:35:18,670
I know they said –

217
00:35:20,715 --> 00:35:23,216
Then?

218
00:35:23,301 --> 00:35:24,843
Then...

219
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:27,846
that means we should–

220
00:35:31,267 --> 00:35:33,644
Yes?

221
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:36,438
shut everything down.

222
00:35:36,522 --> 00:35:39,358
Is that something that –

223
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:42,527
You want us...

224
00:35:42,612 --> 00:35:44,529
to shut everything down?

225
00:35:49,827 --> 00:35:52,788
Then we'll shut everything down.

226
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:23,652
Oh, man.

227
00:36:23,736 --> 00:36:25,737
That's unheard of.

228
00:36:25,822 --> 00:36:28,949
An accident like that –
who could have foreseen that, man?

229
00:36:31,244 --> 00:36:33,286
- Jeez!
- It's unreal, right?

230
00:36:33,371 --> 00:36:36,039
Hell, yeah.

231
00:36:36,124 --> 00:36:38,208
Unbelievable, man.

232
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:42,379
Whoo.

233
00:36:44,757 --> 00:36:47,259
So, bro. God, you look good.

234
00:36:47,343 --> 00:36:49,261
What have you been doing?

235
00:36:49,345 --> 00:36:52,681
Well, you know, just doin'
some stuff for this guy.

236
00:36:52,765 --> 00:36:54,850
- Yeah? Are you making ends meet?
- Yeah.

237
00:36:55,935 --> 00:36:58,020
Hardly.

238
00:36:58,104 --> 00:37:01,189
I know, man.

239
00:37:01,274 --> 00:37:03,233
Look at my digs.

240
00:37:04,485 --> 00:37:06,028
Times are tough, bro.

241
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:10,782
Hey, man, it's not that bad.

242
00:37:12,118 --> 00:37:14,036
Gee, I hope you're not
gonna get into any trouble.

243
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:16,121
Oh, that was just a thing, man.

244
00:37:16,205 --> 00:37:18,123
But that story,
that made you laugh, right?

245
00:37:18,207 --> 00:37:21,626
- That was a funny story, man.
- Fucking car accident.

246
00:37:25,173 --> 00:37:28,383
Hey, so that's, uh – That's it, huh?

247
00:37:28,468 --> 00:37:30,802
That's Ed's famous black book.

248
00:37:33,848 --> 00:37:37,809
The history of the world...
in phone numbers.

249
00:38:01,834 --> 00:38:03,668
Um –

250
00:38:08,424 --> 00:38:10,383
Aw, man.

251
00:38:22,814 --> 00:38:24,981
Something bit me bad!

252
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:31,905
Shh.

253
00:38:31,989 --> 00:38:34,157
Shh! Shh!

254
00:38:36,619 --> 00:38:39,788
Ow!

255
00:38:46,629 --> 00:38:48,505
No!

256
00:38:54,095 --> 00:38:57,055
No! No!

257
00:38:58,015 --> 00:39:00,350
God!

258
00:39:00,434 --> 00:39:02,018
God!

259
00:39:04,397 --> 00:39:05,730
No!

260
00:39:11,028 --> 00:39:12,571
Shh!

261
00:39:15,408 --> 00:39:16,867
Hey, man! Hey!

262
00:39:16,951 --> 00:39:20,662
She's hurt real bad! Could you come here
and call on the phone? I need you!

263
00:39:21,622 --> 00:39:23,165
She's hurt real bad! I'm serious!

264
00:39:23,249 --> 00:39:25,250
You gotta come in here
and call the hospital!

265
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:28,378
Come on, man! I'm serious about this!

266
00:39:28,462 --> 00:39:31,006
I can't do everything by myself, man!

267
00:39:31,090 --> 00:39:33,842
No! Let go!

268
00:39:33,926 --> 00:39:37,596
No! No!

269
00:39:41,225 --> 00:39:43,518
Oh! No!

270
00:39:43,603 --> 00:39:46,104
No! No! No!

271
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:52,277
Hey, man.

272
00:40:25,561 --> 00:40:27,145
Um –

273
00:40:34,779 --> 00:40:36,696
Aw, man.

274
00:40:52,505 --> 00:40:55,423
Okay, Aunt Ruth, I'll try.

275
00:40:55,508 --> 00:41:00,720
I'm gonna study those lines
until I know 'em inside out.

276
00:41:00,805 --> 00:41:03,932
Yep, either right here on
this fabulous leather couch...

277
00:41:04,016 --> 00:41:05,934
or I'll take them with a coffee
into the courtyard...

278
00:41:06,018 --> 00:41:08,770
like a regular movie star.

279
00:41:08,854 --> 00:41:11,356
Oh, I got a real shock
to find your friend Rita here.

280
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:14,651
She was in the shower,
and I opened the door.

281
00:41:14,735 --> 00:41:16,319
Rita.

282
00:41:17,321 --> 00:41:19,030
What do you mean?

283
00:41:20,116 --> 00:41:23,285
Well, she was in an accident.

284
00:41:23,369 --> 00:41:26,079
Rita, your friend.

285
00:41:27,707 --> 00:41:30,041
No, Coco unlocked the door.

286
00:41:31,502 --> 00:41:33,044
No, she didn't see her.

287
00:41:34,839 --> 00:41:36,798
She's sleeping.

288
00:41:37,967 --> 00:41:42,178
I'm sure there's some explanation for this.
I don't think we have to do that.

289
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:48,643
Please don't worry.
Aunt Ruth, we don't need the police.

290
00:42:01,449 --> 00:42:03,408
You're awake.

291
00:42:07,955 --> 00:42:09,873
I think I misunderstood.

292
00:42:09,957 --> 00:42:13,501
I thought you knew my aunt,
and that's why you were here.

293
00:42:13,586 --> 00:42:17,255
I just talked to my aunt on the phone,
and she wants me to call the police.

294
00:42:23,304 --> 00:42:25,680
Rita?

295
00:42:28,934 --> 00:42:31,436
I'm sorry. I –

296
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:33,438
What is it, Rita?

297
00:42:37,234 --> 00:42:39,444
I thought when I woke up –

298
00:42:39,528 --> 00:42:42,030
I thought sleep would do it.

299
00:42:42,114 --> 00:42:44,032
What's wrong?

300
00:42:46,786 --> 00:42:49,204
I don't know who I am.

301
00:42:49,288 --> 00:42:51,373
What do you mean? You're Rita.

302
00:42:51,457 --> 00:42:55,710
No, I'm not. I don't know what my name is.

303
00:42:55,795 --> 00:42:58,755
I don't know who I am.

304
00:43:08,474 --> 00:43:10,392
This is your purse.

305
00:43:10,476 --> 00:43:12,977
Your name must be in your purse.

306
00:43:14,730 --> 00:43:17,232
You want to know, don't you?

307
00:43:18,317 --> 00:43:20,485
- Yes, but –
- Open it.

308
00:44:55,581 --> 00:44:59,417
- So you don't want anything?
- Not here. No, thanks.

309
00:44:59,502 --> 00:45:04,047
- A drink or something?
- No. Thanks, though.

310
00:45:04,131 --> 00:45:06,841
I'll take a cigarette, if you have one.

311
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:12,347
Yeah, just reach inside
my shirt pocket there.

312
00:45:17,269 --> 00:45:19,479
Any new girls on the street lately?

313
00:45:21,941 --> 00:45:23,858
No.

314
00:45:23,943 --> 00:45:25,902
I haven't seen any.

315
00:45:27,571 --> 00:45:29,531
A brunette?

316
00:45:29,615 --> 00:45:31,574
Maybe a little beat-up?

317
00:45:32,660 --> 00:45:34,619
No.

318
00:45:38,165 --> 00:45:40,708
You keep your eyes open
for me, won't you, baby?

319
00:45:40,793 --> 00:45:44,045
- Sure.
- Yeah, you bet you will.

320
00:45:47,049 --> 00:45:48,967
That money –

321
00:45:50,844 --> 00:45:52,762
you don't know where it came from?

322
00:45:52,846 --> 00:45:54,639
Uh-uh.

323
00:45:56,684 --> 00:46:01,020
When you think of them –
the money and the key –

324
00:46:02,982 --> 00:46:05,942
does it make you remember anything?

325
00:46:07,820 --> 00:46:10,363
There's something –

326
00:46:11,824 --> 00:46:14,576
something... there, I –

327
00:46:26,839 --> 00:46:28,548
What did you say?

328
00:46:28,632 --> 00:46:30,758
They fired everyone.

329
00:46:30,843 --> 00:46:33,094
Who fired everyone?

330
00:46:33,178 --> 00:46:37,432
Ray did – Wait!
I-I'm talking on the phone.

331
00:46:37,516 --> 00:46:40,602
And then they closed the set.
Everybody's gone.

332
00:46:40,686 --> 00:46:43,730
You'd better get down here, Adam.

333
00:46:43,814 --> 00:46:45,398
No.

334
00:46:45,482 --> 00:46:48,234
You've gotta talk to Ray.
You've gotta fix this.

335
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:51,446
- I'm going home.
- Home?

336
00:46:51,530 --> 00:46:53,489
Meet me at the office.
We've gotta do something.

337
00:46:53,574 --> 00:46:55,491
You've gotta do something, Adam.

338
00:46:55,576 --> 00:46:57,619
I'm going home, Cynthia.

339
00:46:57,703 --> 00:46:59,746
Adam, listen to me. This isn't like you.

340
00:46:59,830 --> 00:47:01,748
Please come to the office.

341
00:47:01,832 --> 00:47:04,125
- There's gotta be something we can do.
- I'm going home.

342
00:47:15,220 --> 00:47:17,555
I wonder where you were going.

343
00:47:22,394 --> 00:47:24,562
Mulholland Drive.

344
00:47:29,485 --> 00:47:31,402
Mulholland Drive?

345
00:47:33,697 --> 00:47:35,823
That's where I was going –

346
00:47:35,908 --> 00:47:39,035
Mulholland Drive.

347
00:47:40,204 --> 00:47:42,830
Maybe that's where the accident was.

348
00:47:44,124 --> 00:47:46,959
There must be a police report.
We could call.

349
00:47:47,044 --> 00:47:48,503
No.

350
00:47:48,587 --> 00:47:53,007
We could call anonymously from a pay phone
just to see if there was an accident.

351
00:47:53,092 --> 00:47:55,551
Come on.
It'll be just like in the movies.

352
00:47:55,636 --> 00:47:58,221
We'll pretend to be someone else.

353
00:47:59,932 --> 00:48:01,933
I wanna walk around anyway.

354
00:48:02,017 --> 00:48:05,395
I'm in Hollywood,
and I haven't even seen any of it.

355
00:48:05,479 --> 00:48:08,439
Come on, Rita. Do you feel up to it?

356
00:48:15,739 --> 00:48:17,657
Okay.

357
00:48:17,741 --> 00:48:19,992
But... just –

358
00:48:21,995 --> 00:48:24,455
just to see.

359
00:48:24,540 --> 00:48:28,710
Just to see if there was an accident...

360
00:48:28,794 --> 00:48:31,295
on Mulholland Drive.

361
00:49:13,839 --> 00:49:15,339
Lorraine?

362
00:49:16,884 --> 00:49:18,843
Lorraine, you home?

363
00:49:22,222 --> 00:49:23,806
Lorraine?

364
00:49:44,203 --> 00:49:46,120
Now you've done it.

365
00:49:48,373 --> 00:49:51,709
Just forget you ever saw it.
It's better that way.

366
00:49:54,463 --> 00:49:57,548
What the hell are you even doing here?

367
00:50:09,394 --> 00:50:11,062
What are you doing?

368
00:50:14,983 --> 00:50:16,400
That's my jewelry!

369
00:50:33,794 --> 00:50:37,171
That bastard! You bastard!

370
00:50:37,256 --> 00:50:39,423
He's probably upset, Lorraine.

371
00:50:45,722 --> 00:50:47,098
What are you doing?

372
00:50:49,476 --> 00:50:52,728
Stop it! Stop it!

373
00:50:52,813 --> 00:50:55,022
Adam, stop it!

374
00:50:55,899 --> 00:50:58,359
Stop it! Stop it!

375
00:50:58,443 --> 00:51:02,864
Adam! Cut – Cut it out! Ow!

376
00:51:02,948 --> 00:51:06,242
You're hurting me! Gene!

377
00:51:06,326 --> 00:51:08,077
You're hurting me!

378
00:51:11,206 --> 00:51:14,876
That ain't no way to treat your wife, buddy.
I don't care what she's done.

379
00:51:16,295 --> 00:51:17,753
Throw him out!

380
00:51:18,547 --> 00:51:20,715
Throw him out!

381
00:51:20,799 --> 00:51:22,717
Damn you, Adam!

382
00:51:23,635 --> 00:51:25,094
Throw him out!

383
00:51:31,810 --> 00:51:33,895
Get out!

384
00:52:13,226 --> 00:52:14,810
Let's hide it.

385
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:02,024
There's one.

386
00:53:17,958 --> 00:53:20,835
Hollywood Police Department.

387
00:53:20,919 --> 00:53:23,921
I'm inquiring about an accident that happened
last night on Mulholland Drive.

388
00:53:24,006 --> 00:53:26,424
Hold, please. I'll connect you to Traffic.

389
00:53:28,427 --> 00:53:31,929
- Sergeant Baxter.
- Hi. I'm inquiring –

390
00:53:33,598 --> 00:53:37,268
Well, I heard a sound last night that
sounded sort of like a car crash...

391
00:53:37,352 --> 00:53:41,355
and, well, I want to know if there was
an accident on Mulholland Drive.

392
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:43,357
Yes, there was.

393
00:53:43,442 --> 00:53:46,527
- Can you tell me what happened?
- No, I can't.

394
00:53:46,611 --> 00:53:49,405
- Was anyone hurt?
- May I have your name, please?

395
00:53:56,329 --> 00:53:58,539
There was an accident.

396
00:53:58,623 --> 00:54:02,793
He wouldn't tell me anything else,
but that was your accident. I just know it was.

397
00:54:04,171 --> 00:54:06,756
Maybe there's something
about it in the papers.

398
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:09,091
I'll buy you a cup of coffee
and we can see.

399
00:54:13,305 --> 00:54:16,599
Maybe it happened so late,
it's not in today's paper.

400
00:54:16,683 --> 00:54:18,642
There's nothing?

401
00:54:20,187 --> 00:54:22,980
Not that I can see.

402
00:54:24,149 --> 00:54:25,941
That's okay.

403
00:54:29,571 --> 00:54:31,489
Thanks...

404
00:54:33,658 --> 00:54:34,825
Diane.

405
00:54:40,582 --> 00:54:43,084
Will that be all?
Would you like your check?

406
00:54:43,168 --> 00:54:45,002
Rita, you want something?

407
00:54:47,964 --> 00:54:50,925
No, just – just the coffee.

408
00:54:51,009 --> 00:54:53,469
- We'll take our check.
- Okay.

409
00:54:59,518 --> 00:55:02,061
- What is it, Rita?
- Shh.

410
00:55:09,653 --> 00:55:12,113
I remember something.

411
00:55:12,197 --> 00:55:14,448
I remember something!

412
00:55:17,369 --> 00:55:20,788
- What is it?
- Diane Selwyn.

413
00:55:20,872 --> 00:55:23,374
Maybe that's my name!

414
00:55:24,835 --> 00:55:26,710
Selwyn. Selwyn.

415
00:55:28,713 --> 00:55:32,758
"D. Selwyn." It's the only one.

416
00:55:32,843 --> 00:55:34,802
I'm gonna call.

417
00:55:42,060 --> 00:55:44,353
It's strange to be calling yourself.

418
00:55:44,437 --> 00:55:47,106
Maybe it's not me.

419
00:55:55,240 --> 00:55:58,784
Hello, it's me. Leave a message.

420
00:56:01,371 --> 00:56:03,831
That's not my voice.

421
00:56:04,875 --> 00:56:06,834
But I know her.

422
00:56:08,753 --> 00:56:12,256
Maybe that isn't Diane Selwyn's voice.

423
00:56:12,340 --> 00:56:14,550
Maybe that's your roommate.

424
00:56:14,634 --> 00:56:17,011
Or if it is Diane Selwyn...

425
00:56:17,095 --> 00:56:20,306
she could tell you who you are.

426
00:56:20,390 --> 00:56:22,766
Maybe.

427
00:56:22,851 --> 00:56:24,935
Maybe. Maybe.

Adam Kesher?

443
00:58:04,744 --> 00:58:06,537
Yeah, what is it, Cookie?

444
00:58:06,621 --> 00:58:11,709
I'm sorry, Mr. Kesher, but there seems to be
some problem with your credit cards.

445
00:58:11,793 --> 00:58:14,545
What? I-I pay you cash, Cookie.

446
00:58:16,715 --> 00:58:20,718
Mira, ese.
Two guys from your bank came by.

447
00:58:21,386 --> 00:58:23,053
My bank?

448
00:58:24,097 --> 00:58:26,849
- How-How'd they know I was here?
- I don't know.

449
00:58:27,892 --> 00:58:29,810
What'd they say?

450
00:58:29,894 --> 00:58:34,315
I'm afraid they said to tell you that
you're maxed out at your bank...

451
00:58:34,399 --> 00:58:37,735
and that your line of credit
has been canceled.

452
00:58:39,404 --> 00:58:42,990
That's unbelievable. Huh.

453
00:58:43,074 --> 00:58:45,284
Well, look, uh...

454
00:58:46,453 --> 00:58:49,371
I , uh – I don't know what's going on.

455
00:58:50,373 --> 00:58:53,083
That is so much baloney.

456
00:58:53,168 --> 00:58:54,710
Uh –

457
00:58:54,794 --> 00:58:57,004
But I got enough cash for you, Cookie.

458
00:58:57,088 --> 00:59:01,383
Oh, I know. I know. Don't worry.

459
00:59:01,468 --> 00:59:04,261
But, ese, I'm sorry.

460
00:59:04,346 --> 00:59:06,513
It was my duty to inform you.

461
00:59:07,849 --> 00:59:10,184
Oye, carnal.

462
00:59:10,268 --> 00:59:14,438
Whoever you're hiding from,
they know where you are.

463
00:59:16,274 --> 00:59:17,941
Right.

464
00:59:18,985 --> 00:59:20,652
I'm sorry.

465
00:59:43,301 --> 00:59:45,886
Hello?

466
00:59:45,970 --> 00:59:47,888
Someone maybe shut off my money.

467
00:59:47,972 --> 00:59:49,890
I know. Where are you, Adam?

468
00:59:49,974 --> 00:59:52,226
I'm sorry.
What do you mean, you know?

469
00:59:52,310 --> 00:59:56,605
Somebody called. When they couldn't get you,
they told me you were as good as broke.

470
00:59:56,689 --> 00:59:58,899
I didn't believe them,
so I made a few calls.

471
00:59:58,983 --> 01:00:01,318
- And?
- You're broke.

472
01:00:01,403 --> 01:00:02,945
Yeah, but I'm not broke!

473
01:00:03,029 --> 01:00:05,823
I know, but you're broke. Where are you?

474
01:00:07,283 --> 01:00:09,993
I'm at Cookie's, downtown.

475
01:00:10,078 --> 01:00:13,789
Do you know somebody
called the Cowboy?

476
01:00:14,749 --> 01:00:17,084
- The Cowboy?
- Yeah.

477
01:00:17,168 --> 01:00:18,460
The Cowboy.

478
01:00:18,545 --> 01:00:21,922
This guy, the Cowboy,
wants to see you.

479
01:00:22,006 --> 01:00:24,842
Jason said he thought it'd be a good idea.

480
01:00:26,052 --> 01:00:29,388
Oh, Jason thought it'd be a good idea
for me to go see the Cowboy.

481
01:00:29,472 --> 01:00:32,766
Well, should I wear my 10-gallon hat
and my six-shooters?

482
01:00:32,851 --> 01:00:36,437
Listen, something tells me that this guy
is connected to what's happening.

483
01:00:37,480 --> 01:00:41,442
Adam, I think you should do it,
and I think you should do it right away.

484
01:00:41,526 --> 01:00:43,444
What's going on, Cynthia?

485
01:00:43,528 --> 01:00:45,904
It's been a very strange day.

486
01:00:47,782 --> 01:00:49,700
And getting stranger.

487
01:00:52,078 --> 01:00:55,372
So, where do I meet this Cowboy?
Do I have to ride out to the range?

488
01:00:56,249 --> 01:00:58,459
Sort of, funny boy.

489
01:00:58,543 --> 01:01:00,544
If I tell him the meeting's on...

490
01:01:00,628 --> 01:01:03,464
you'll have to go to the top
of Beachwood Canyon...

491
01:01:03,548 --> 01:01:07,509
and there's a corral up there
where he'll be.

492
01:01:07,594 --> 01:01:10,179
Oh, you've gotta be kidding me.

493
01:01:10,263 --> 01:01:12,639
Will you meet with him?

494
01:01:12,724 --> 01:01:15,100
Yeah. Sure.

495
01:01:15,185 --> 01:01:18,312
No, i-it's been that kind of a day.
When?

496
01:01:18,396 --> 01:01:20,481
Um, I'll call him right away...

497
01:01:20,565 --> 01:01:23,233
and then I'll call you back.

498
01:01:23,318 --> 01:01:27,404
You know, you – you could stay
at my place if you – if you wanted.

499
01:01:27,489 --> 01:01:30,657
Uh, Cynthia, no.
I don't think that would be a good idea.

500
01:01:30,742 --> 01:01:32,993
I was just offering a place to stay.

501
01:01:33,077 --> 01:01:36,246
Yes, and I appreciate the offer, Cynthia.
I'll find a place.

502
01:01:36,331 --> 01:01:39,708
Just go and give that Cowboy a yodel
and get on back to me.

503
01:01:39,792 --> 01:01:42,711
Okay. But you don't know
what you're missing.

504
01:01:42,795 --> 01:01:46,840
Uh, just get along, little doggie,
and call me back.

505
01:01:58,770 --> 01:02:01,188
It's right about here – Sierra Bonita.

506
01:02:01,272 --> 01:02:03,190
Not too far away.

507
01:02:04,317 --> 01:02:06,276
What's wrong with that?

508
01:02:07,403 --> 01:02:09,321
I'm not sure about this.

509
01:02:11,199 --> 01:02:13,408
I know you're afraid of something.

510
01:02:14,786 --> 01:02:16,954
We'll be careful, I promise.

511
01:02:18,456 --> 01:02:22,084
Tomorrow, we'll go over there...

512
01:02:22,168 --> 01:02:24,253
and we'll find out.

513
01:02:37,475 --> 01:02:40,477
It'll be okay.

514
01:02:41,980 --> 01:02:43,897
It's probably Coco.

515
01:02:47,860 --> 01:02:50,153
Yes? May I help you?

516
01:02:50,238 --> 01:02:52,447
Someone is in trouble.

517
01:02:54,284 --> 01:02:57,077
Who are you?

518
01:02:57,161 --> 01:02:59,997
What are you doing in Ruth's apartment?

519
01:03:00,081 --> 01:03:02,165
She's letting me stay here.

520
01:03:02,250 --> 01:03:04,835
I'm her niece. My name's Betty.

521
01:03:04,919 --> 01:03:06,837
No, it's not.

522
01:03:06,921 --> 01:03:09,298
That's not what she said.

523
01:03:09,382 --> 01:03:14,094
Someone is in trouble!
Something bad is happening!

524
01:03:14,178 --> 01:03:17,639
Well, I-I'm sorry,
but I don't know who you are, and –

525
01:03:17,724 --> 01:03:20,767
Louise? What are you doing, Louise?

526
01:03:20,852 --> 01:03:22,936
I – Oh, Coco.

527
01:03:23,021 --> 01:03:26,565
I've been trying to get a hold of you
since 3:00 this afternoon.

528
01:03:26,649 --> 01:03:30,152
That one is in my room,
and she won't leave.

529
01:03:30,236 --> 01:03:33,280
I want you to get her out.
I want you to get her out now!

530
01:03:33,364 --> 01:03:36,700
Uh, this is Louise Bonner.
I'm sure she meant well.

531
01:03:36,784 --> 01:03:40,871
Louise, this is Betty.
This is Ruth's niece.

532
01:03:40,955 --> 01:03:43,999
In fact, fortunately I was just on my way
over here to see Betty.

533
01:03:44,083 --> 01:03:46,793
Betty's a young actress,
and I was just delivering...

534
01:03:46,878 --> 01:03:50,213
some faxed pages of a scene
for a big audition tomorrow.

535
01:03:50,298 --> 01:03:53,050
- Well, here they are, honey.
- Oh, thank you.

536
01:03:53,134 --> 01:03:55,719
Come along now, Louise.
I'll take you home.

537
01:03:55,803 --> 01:03:57,471
I'm sorry.
It happens sometimes.

538
01:03:57,555 --> 01:03:58,805
- No.
- Come on.

539
01:03:58,890 --> 01:04:01,308
No. She said it was someone else
who was in trouble.

540
01:04:01,392 --> 01:04:03,226
Stop it, Louise. I'm taking you home.

541
01:04:04,562 --> 01:04:06,521
Come on. I-I –

542
01:04:06,606 --> 01:04:08,565
- Good night, Betty.
- Good night.

543
01:04:09,442 --> 01:04:11,401
Good night.

544
01:04:21,579 --> 01:04:23,580
Whoa.

545
01:04:49,273 --> 01:04:51,608
Cowboy.

546
01:05:59,844 --> 01:06:03,180
- Howdy.
- Howdy to you.

547
01:06:05,683 --> 01:06:07,017
Beautiful evenin'.

548
01:06:08,519 --> 01:06:09,978
Yeah.

549
01:06:11,397 --> 01:06:14,065
Sure wanna thank you for comin'
all the way up here to see me...

550
01:06:14,150 --> 01:06:17,319
from that nice hotel downtown.

551
01:06:18,821 --> 01:06:21,948
No problem. What's on your mind?

552
01:06:22,033 --> 01:06:26,495
Well, now, here's a man
who wants to get right down to it.

553
01:06:26,579 --> 01:06:29,372
Kinda anxious to get to it, are ya?

554
01:06:29,457 --> 01:06:31,041
Whatever.

555
01:06:32,877 --> 01:06:34,461
A man's attitude –

556
01:06:35,546 --> 01:06:38,340
A man's attitude goes some ways...

557
01:06:38,424 --> 01:06:41,259
to the way his life will be.

558
01:06:41,344 --> 01:06:43,804
Is that something you might agree with?

559
01:06:43,888 --> 01:06:45,639
Sure.

560
01:06:45,723 --> 01:06:47,641
Now, did you answer...

561
01:06:47,725 --> 01:06:50,352
because that's what you thought
I wanted to hear...

562
01:06:50,436 --> 01:06:52,646
or did you think about what I said...

563
01:06:52,730 --> 01:06:56,691
and answer 'cause
you truly believe that to be right?

564
01:06:57,944 --> 01:07:01,988
I agree with what you said. Truly.

565
01:07:03,741 --> 01:07:05,700
What'd I say?

566
01:07:08,538 --> 01:07:12,249
That a man's attitude determines,
to a large extent, how his life will be.

567
01:07:13,918 --> 01:07:16,503
So since you agree...

568
01:07:16,587 --> 01:07:21,550
you must be a person
who does not care about the good life.

569
01:07:21,634 --> 01:07:23,844
How's that?

570
01:07:25,429 --> 01:07:29,474
Well, stop for a little second
and think about it.

571
01:07:29,559 --> 01:07:31,768
Can you do that for me?

572
01:07:34,146 --> 01:07:37,232
Okay. I'm thinkin'.

573
01:07:40,653 --> 01:07:42,696
No, you're not thinkin'.

574
01:07:42,780 --> 01:07:45,782
You're too busy
bein' a smart aleck to be thinkin'.

575
01:07:47,118 --> 01:07:50,954
Now, I want you to think
and stop bein' a smart aleck.

576
01:07:51,038 --> 01:07:52,956
Can you try that for me?

577
01:07:53,875 --> 01:07:57,961
Look, where's this going?
What do you want me to do?

578
01:07:58,045 --> 01:08:01,339
There's sometimes a buggy.

579
01:08:01,424 --> 01:08:03,800
How many drivers does a buggy have?

580
01:08:03,885 --> 01:08:05,969
One.

581
01:08:06,053 --> 01:08:10,015
So let's just say
I'm drivin' this buggy...

582
01:08:10,099 --> 01:08:14,227
and if you fix your attitude,
you can ride along with me.

583
01:08:15,146 --> 01:08:16,563
Okay.

584
01:08:16,647 --> 01:08:19,566
I want you to go back to work tomorrow.

585
01:08:20,568 --> 01:08:23,111
You were recasting
the lead actress anyway.

586
01:08:23,195 --> 01:08:27,365
Audition many girls for the part.

587
01:08:27,450 --> 01:08:32,329
When you see the girl that was shown
to you earlier today, you will say...

588
01:08:32,413 --> 01:08:35,749
"This is the girl."

589
01:08:35,833 --> 01:08:38,293
The rest of the cast can stay.

590
01:08:38,377 --> 01:08:41,004
That's up to you.

591
01:08:41,088 --> 01:08:43,965
But that lead girl is not up to you.

592
01:08:46,010 --> 01:08:48,887
Now, you will see me one more time...

593
01:08:48,971 --> 01:08:51,514
if you do good.

594
01:08:51,599 --> 01:08:54,643
You'll see me two more times...

595
01:08:54,727 --> 01:08:57,103
if you do bad.

596
01:08:57,188 --> 01:08:59,147
Good night.

597
01:09:23,798 --> 01:09:25,715
You're still here?

598
01:09:25,800 --> 01:09:28,635
I came back. I thought
that's what you wanted.

599
01:09:28,719 --> 01:09:30,637
Nobody wants you here.

600
01:09:30,721 --> 01:09:33,348
Really?

601
01:09:33,432 --> 01:09:36,101
My parents are right upstairs.
They think you've left.

602
01:09:36,185 --> 01:09:40,313
- So? Surprise.
- I can call them. I can call my dad.

603
01:09:40,398 --> 01:09:42,565
But you won't.

604
01:09:42,650 --> 01:09:45,986
If you're trying to blackmail me,
it's not gonna work.

605
01:09:46,070 --> 01:09:48,029
You're playing a dangerous game here.

606
01:09:48,114 --> 01:09:50,490
You know what I want.
It's not that difficult.

607
01:09:50,574 --> 01:09:54,077
Get out! Get out before I call my dad!

608
01:09:54,161 --> 01:09:57,330
He trusts you. You're his best friend.

609
01:09:57,415 --> 01:09:59,833
This will be the end of everything.

610
01:09:59,917 --> 01:10:03,169
What about you?
What will your dad think about you?

611
01:10:03,254 --> 01:10:07,590
Stop! Just stop it!
That's what you said from the beginning!

612
01:10:07,675 --> 01:10:11,011
Now, if I tell what happened,
they'll arrest you and put you in jail.

613
01:10:11,095 --> 01:10:13,221
So, get out of here before –

614
01:10:14,265 --> 01:10:16,182
B-Before what?

615
01:10:16,267 --> 01:10:20,186
Before... I kill you.

616
01:10:20,271 --> 01:10:22,605
Then they'd put you in jail.

617
01:10:25,776 --> 01:10:29,696
Then I cry, cry, cry,
and then I say with big emotion...

618
01:10:29,780 --> 01:10:32,532
"I hate you! I hate us both!"

619
01:10:35,703 --> 01:10:39,539
- Such a lame scene.
- But you are really good.

620
01:10:40,791 --> 01:10:43,084
Thank you, darling.

621
01:10:57,933 --> 01:11:00,226
Hi there. Who are you?

622
01:11:01,645 --> 01:11:03,563
Uh –

623
01:11:03,647 --> 01:11:05,565
Betty?

624
01:11:11,363 --> 01:11:14,991
Uh, Betty,
can I see you outside for a minute?

625
01:11:29,507 --> 01:11:32,967
- What is it, Coco?
- Your aunt called.

626
01:11:34,512 --> 01:11:36,096
I was afraid of that.

627
01:11:36,180 --> 01:11:38,556
She wants to know
who's staying in her apartment.

628
01:11:40,059 --> 01:11:43,019
It's just for a night or two,
until she finds her own place.

629
01:11:43,104 --> 01:11:45,522
I tried to explain that to Aunt Ruth,
but the connection was bad...

630
01:11:45,606 --> 01:11:48,608
and her plane was leaving,
and she got it all mixed up.

631
01:11:48,692 --> 01:11:50,860
I kept telling her that
it was my friend Rita...

632
01:11:50,945 --> 01:11:53,363
and she kept saying
she didn't know any Ritas.

633
01:11:54,698 --> 01:11:56,783
- Look at me straight, sweetie.
- Coco.

634
01:11:56,867 --> 01:11:58,952
She's very nice.

635
01:11:59,036 --> 01:12:00,954
Honey, you're a good kid.

636
01:12:01,038 --> 01:12:04,165
But what you're telling me
is a load of horse puckey...

637
01:12:04,250 --> 01:12:07,085
even though it comes from a good place.

638
01:12:07,169 --> 01:12:09,712
Now, I'm gonna trust you
to sort this thing out.

639
01:12:09,797 --> 01:12:11,714
Thank you.

640
01:12:11,799 --> 01:12:14,134
Don't make me out to be a sucker.

641
01:12:14,218 --> 01:12:16,511
Louise Bonner said
there's trouble in there.

642
01:12:16,595 --> 01:12:18,513
Remember last night?

643
01:12:18,597 --> 01:12:22,142
Well, sometimes she's wrong.

644
01:12:22,226 --> 01:12:26,020
But if there is trouble, get rid of it.

645
01:12:36,240 --> 01:12:38,324
Is everything all right?

646
01:12:38,409 --> 01:12:40,326
Is it bad for you that I'm here?

647
01:12:40,411 --> 01:12:43,663
No, no. Everything is A-okay.

648
01:12:43,747 --> 01:12:45,957
Now, I've gotta fix that sandwich.

649
01:12:46,041 --> 01:12:48,960
And my audition is in one hour!

650
01:13:08,939 --> 01:13:11,733
I hope I'm back in a couple of hours.

651
01:13:11,817 --> 01:13:14,903
- And don't drink all the Coke.
- Good luck!

652
01:13:14,987 --> 01:13:18,239
Now, when I get back I'll keep
the cab waiting, so be ready to go.

653
01:13:18,324 --> 01:13:20,283
- Okay.
- Okay?

654
01:13:48,437 --> 01:13:50,313
Voilà.

655
01:13:50,397 --> 01:13:52,815
Betty Elms...

656
01:13:52,900 --> 01:13:56,486
I would like you to meet
Jack Tuptman, my assistant...

657
01:13:57,446 --> 01:13:59,322
Woody Katz...

658
01:13:59,406 --> 01:14:01,908
who we have cast in the part of Chuck
and will do the scene with you...

659
01:14:03,827 --> 01:14:05,453
Bob Brooker, our director...

660
01:14:05,537 --> 01:14:08,248
and Julie Chadwick.

661
01:14:08,332 --> 01:14:10,833
Now, our surprise guest...

662
01:14:10,918 --> 01:14:13,086
Linney James.

663
01:14:13,170 --> 01:14:15,588
Alas, we can't afford her
to cast our show...

664
01:14:15,673 --> 01:14:18,299
but, well, as casting agents go...

665
01:14:18,384 --> 01:14:20,843
she is the best.

666
01:14:20,928 --> 01:14:24,138
Why, thank you, Wally. Hello, Betty.

667
01:14:24,223 --> 01:14:26,099
Very pleased to meet you.

668
01:14:26,183 --> 01:14:28,434
This is my assistant, Nicki.

669
01:14:29,186 --> 01:14:32,105
Oh!
And the ever-lovely Martha.

670
01:14:32,189 --> 01:14:34,857
Martha Johnson, whom you met out front.

671
01:14:37,027 --> 01:14:38,987
Hi.

672
01:14:39,071 --> 01:14:42,073
So, shall we... give it a go?

673
01:14:43,450 --> 01:14:47,245
Uh, would you like a water
or a coffee before we begin?

674
01:14:47,329 --> 01:14:49,247
No, I'm-I'm fine.

675
01:14:49,331 --> 01:14:52,792
Well, then, let's everyone take a seat.

676
01:14:55,421 --> 01:14:56,796
Betty...

677
01:14:56,880 --> 01:15:00,508
why don't you join Woody over there
and we'll play the scene.

678
01:15:01,635 --> 01:15:05,054
Bob, do you have anything you wish to say?

679
01:15:05,139 --> 01:15:08,141
Something to Betty before we begin?

680
01:15:08,225 --> 01:15:10,893
No. It's not a contest.

681
01:15:12,396 --> 01:15:16,357
The two of them, with themselves.

682
01:15:18,235 --> 01:15:21,946
So don't play it for real...

683
01:15:22,031 --> 01:15:24,991
until it gets real.

684
01:15:29,913 --> 01:15:31,414
Okay.

685
01:15:32,249 --> 01:15:36,002
- Just tell me where it hurts, baby.
- What?

686
01:15:36,086 --> 01:15:38,254
Hey, Bobby,
I wanna play this one nice and close...

687
01:15:38,339 --> 01:15:40,173
like we did with that other girl –

688
01:15:40,257 --> 01:15:43,009
What's her name? The one with
the black hair. It felt kind of good.

689
01:15:43,093 --> 01:15:45,011
- What do you think?
- That's good, Woody.

690
01:15:45,095 --> 01:15:47,347
Just don't rush that line again.

691
01:15:47,431 --> 01:15:51,017
I told you, the line
where you say, "Before what?"

692
01:15:52,102 --> 01:15:54,812
Bobby, acting is reacting.

693
01:15:54,897 --> 01:15:58,316
I just play off 'em. They all say, um...

694
01:15:58,400 --> 01:16:00,318
"They're gonna arrest you," like that.

695
01:16:00,402 --> 01:16:02,695
Then, "They'll put you in jail."
They all say it the same way.

696
01:16:02,780 --> 01:16:04,989
So when they say it, I just react.

697
01:16:05,074 --> 01:16:06,532
- What's your name?
- Betty.

698
01:16:06,617 --> 01:16:11,996
Yeah, Betty.
Look, you don't rush it, I don't rush it. Okay?

699
01:16:12,081 --> 01:16:14,999
Now, we're gonna play this
nice and close.

700
01:16:15,084 --> 01:16:17,960
Just like in the movies, okay?

701
01:16:20,464 --> 01:16:22,715
Dad's best friend goes to work.

702
01:16:24,009 --> 01:16:26,135
Bob?

703
01:16:28,514 --> 01:16:31,474
And... action!

704
01:16:36,563 --> 01:16:38,481
You're still here.

705
01:16:39,817 --> 01:16:43,569
I came back.
Thought that's what you wanted.

706
01:16:43,654 --> 01:16:46,906
- Nobody wants you here.
- Really?

707
01:16:46,990 --> 01:16:49,617
My parents are right upstairs.

708
01:16:49,701 --> 01:16:51,619
They think you've left.

709
01:16:51,703 --> 01:16:53,663
So, surprise!

710
01:16:53,747 --> 01:16:57,083
I can call them. I can call my dad.

711
01:16:57,167 --> 01:16:59,127
But you won't.

712
01:17:14,810 --> 01:17:17,353
You're playing a dangerous game here.

713
01:17:19,106 --> 01:17:21,983
If you're trying to blackmail me...

714
01:17:22,067 --> 01:17:24,193
it's not gonna work.

715
01:17:26,113 --> 01:17:28,531
You know what I want.

716
01:17:28,615 --> 01:17:30,533
It's not that difficult.

717
01:17:33,579 --> 01:17:35,538
Get out.

718
01:17:37,249 --> 01:17:40,626
Get out before I call my dad.

719
01:17:40,711 --> 01:17:42,962
He trusts you.

720
01:17:43,046 --> 01:17:45,214
You're his...

721
01:17:45,299 --> 01:17:47,425
best friend.

722
01:17:51,180 --> 01:17:53,598
This will be the end of everything.

723
01:17:56,226 --> 01:17:57,894
What about you?

724
01:17:57,978 --> 01:18:00,313
What'll your dad think about you?

725
01:18:00,397 --> 01:18:01,939
Don't.

726
01:18:03,192 --> 01:18:05,109
Stop it.

727
01:18:06,653 --> 01:18:08,821
That's what you said from the beginning.

728
01:18:10,908 --> 01:18:12,825
If I tell them what happened...

729
01:18:12,910 --> 01:18:15,536
they'll arrest you and put you in jail.

730
01:18:22,544 --> 01:18:24,670
So get out of here...

731
01:18:24,755 --> 01:18:26,714
before –

732
01:18:29,843 --> 01:18:31,761
Before what?

733
01:18:50,113 --> 01:18:52,698
Before...

734
01:18:52,783 --> 01:18:54,784
I kill you.

735
01:19:10,050 --> 01:19:12,552
Well, then they'd put you in jail.

736
01:19:21,228 --> 01:19:22,937
I hate you.

737
01:19:24,856 --> 01:19:26,816
I hate us both.

738
01:19:42,499 --> 01:19:45,585
- I'm gonna take her over there.
- Yeah, big time.

739
01:19:49,798 --> 01:19:51,716
Well, there it was.

740
01:19:51,800 --> 01:19:55,094
Yeah, there it was, all right.

741
01:19:55,178 --> 01:19:57,972
Baby, you've got a way with you. Really.

742
01:19:58,056 --> 01:19:59,807
Bob?

743
01:20:01,685 --> 01:20:04,562
Very good. Really.

744
01:20:04,646 --> 01:20:07,273
I mean, it was forced, maybe...

745
01:20:07,357 --> 01:20:11,360
but still humanistic.

746
01:20:11,445 --> 01:20:14,113
Yeah. Very good.

747
01:20:14,197 --> 01:20:17,033
Really. Really.

748
01:20:23,248 --> 01:20:25,916
Oh, I thank you, Betty...

749
01:20:26,001 --> 01:20:28,628
and I really mean that sincerely.

750
01:20:28,712 --> 01:20:31,631
I mean, it was extraordinary.

751
01:20:32,883 --> 01:20:34,800
You've done your aunt proud today.

752
01:20:34,885 --> 01:20:38,804
I am going to tell her that
first chance I get.

753
01:20:38,889 --> 01:20:41,307
Now, you and I ...

754
01:20:41,391 --> 01:20:43,309
are going to speak again very soon.

755
01:20:43,393 --> 01:20:45,686
Thank you, Mr. Brown.

756
01:20:45,771 --> 01:20:47,688
Thank you, Wally.

757
01:20:47,773 --> 01:20:51,108
I'm sure you all have a lot to talk about.
We'll walk Betty out.

758
01:20:51,193 --> 01:20:55,112
Oh, well, yes, indeed.
And it was our pleasure, Linney.

759
01:20:55,197 --> 01:20:57,698
Now, don't you be a stranger around here.

760
01:20:57,783 --> 01:21:00,743
- We'd love to have you here.
- Come on, Betty.

761
01:21:00,827 --> 01:21:02,745
Thank you again, Mr. Brown.

762
01:21:02,829 --> 01:21:07,833
And it was nice meeting all of you.
Bye.

763
01:21:09,586 --> 01:21:11,170
Bye.

764
01:21:13,590 --> 01:21:16,509
- Wow!
- She's a slam dunk.

765
01:21:16,593 --> 01:21:18,511
Where the hell did you find her?

766
01:21:18,595 --> 01:21:20,763
God, that was awful.

767
01:21:22,265 --> 01:21:24,850
Not you, Betty.
You were stellar. And I mean that.

768
01:21:24,935 --> 01:21:26,644
But poor Wally.

769
01:21:26,728 --> 01:21:28,938
- He'll never get that picture made.
- No.

770
01:21:29,022 --> 01:21:31,315
Wally's days were up 20 years ago.

771
01:21:31,400 --> 01:21:34,527
You know Woody Katz
is only doing it for a favor.

772
01:21:34,611 --> 01:21:36,696
And the cast, I hear, so far is terrible.

773
01:21:36,780 --> 01:21:38,864
Oh, God, terrible.

774
01:21:38,949 --> 01:21:41,200
That poor old fool Wally.

775
01:21:41,284 --> 01:21:45,204
He was very nice,
and he seemed so sweet.

776
01:21:45,288 --> 01:21:48,249
And Wally – Mr. Brown –
is a very close friend of my aunt's, and –

777
01:21:48,333 --> 01:21:51,293
Settle down, Betty.
Don't get me wrong. I love Wally.

778
01:21:51,378 --> 01:21:55,005
I ought to.
I was married to him for 10 years.

779
01:21:55,090 --> 01:21:58,050
And I love actors. All actors.

780
01:21:58,135 --> 01:22:01,387
We just get a little catty sometimes.

781
01:22:01,471 --> 01:22:04,181
Now, we wanna take you across
and introduce you to a director...

782
01:22:04,266 --> 01:22:06,183
who's a head above the rest.

783
01:22:06,268 --> 01:22:09,145

You just show me where to sign.

Look, I love you...

823
01:24:20,277 --> 01:24:23,195
but there is no way they are gonna
let me cast this thing until I've seen everyone.

824
01:24:23,280 --> 01:24:25,364

01:28:03,416 --> 01:28:05,542
Those men out front in the car.

880
01:28:05,627 --> 01:28:07,169
- Do you know 'em?
- No.

881
01:28:08,421 --> 01:28:11,340
Keep going.
Go around to the back.

882
01:29:00,557 --> 01:29:02,516
Selwyn, number 12.

883
01:29:25,957 --> 01:29:28,125
Now you got me scared.

884
01:29:53,276 --> 01:29:56,820
You see? I told you there was
nothing to be afraid of.

885
01:30:59,467 --> 01:31:00,926
Betty, wait. Wait.

886
01:31:03,346 --> 01:31:04,972
Don't.

887
01:31:31,165 --> 01:31:32,708
No one's home.

888
01:31:33,876 --> 01:31:35,627
Yes?

889
01:31:36,879 --> 01:31:38,046
Diane?

890
01:31:40,675 --> 01:31:42,175
Number 17.

891
01:31:44,387 --> 01:31:46,346
But it said number 12.

892
01:31:48,891 --> 01:31:52,227
I switched apartments with her.
She's in 17.

893
01:31:52,895 --> 01:31:54,896
It's down at the end on the left.

894
01:31:59,319 --> 01:32:02,321
But she hasn't been around
for a few days.

895
01:32:04,449 --> 01:32:06,867
Oh. We'll leave her a note.

896
01:32:06,951 --> 01:32:08,910
I'll go with you.

897
01:32:11,080 --> 01:32:13,457
She's still got some of my stuff.

898
01:32:19,088 --> 01:32:21,173
You go ahead. I gotta get that.

899
01:32:36,731 --> 01:32:39,316
I guess you're not Diane Selwyn.

900
01:32:39,400 --> 01:32:41,276
Guess I'm not.

901
01:33:18,314 --> 01:33:20,315
There's no one home, I guess.

902
01:33:50,096 --> 01:33:51,680
- Come on.
- What are you doing?

903
01:33:51,764 --> 01:33:53,849
Come on. Help me in.

904
01:33:53,933 --> 01:33:56,017
Come on.
I'll open the front door.

905
01:33:57,311 --> 01:33:58,895
No.

906
01:34:03,693 --> 01:34:05,277
Come on.

907
01:34:08,906 --> 01:34:10,365
Come on.

908
01:36:32,967 --> 01:36:34,884
Rita!

909
01:36:37,179 --> 01:36:39,139
I know what you're doing.

910
01:37:00,369 --> 01:37:02,621
I know what you have to do.

911
01:37:05,416 --> 01:37:07,375
But let me do it.

912
01:37:16,427 --> 01:37:18,386
Let me do it.

913
01:37:41,744 --> 01:37:43,912
You look like someone else.

914
01:38:06,268 --> 01:38:07,686
Good night, Betty.

915
01:38:08,562 --> 01:38:10,605
You don't have to wear that in the house.

916
01:38:10,690 --> 01:38:12,691
What?

917
01:38:12,775 --> 01:38:14,526
The wig.

918
01:38:15,778 --> 01:38:19,072
Oh, I was just looking at myself again.

919
01:38:19,156 --> 01:38:21,074
I'll take it off to sleep.

920
01:38:21,158 --> 01:38:25,787
- And you don't have to sleep on that couch.
- No, it's okay.

921
01:38:25,871 --> 01:38:28,957
No, it's not. This is a huge bed.

922
01:38:29,041 --> 01:38:32,127
Come on. Just get in
and get a good night's sleep.

923
01:39:03,409 --> 01:39:05,577
It's more comfortable
than the couch, isn't it?

924
01:39:05,661 --> 01:39:08,663
Yes.

925
01:39:15,379 --> 01:39:17,338
Thank you, Betty.

926
01:39:18,883 --> 01:39:21,050
It's nothing.

927
01:39:21,135 --> 01:39:23,428
I shouldn't have let you
sleep on the couch last night.

928
01:39:23,512 --> 01:39:26,222
No, I mean...

929
01:39:26,307 --> 01:39:29,184
thank you for everything.

930
01:39:32,521 --> 01:39:34,439
You're welcome.

931
01:39:44,617 --> 01:39:46,701
Good night, sweet Betty.

932
01:39:56,629 --> 01:39:58,588
Good night.

933
01:40:40,464 --> 01:40:42,757
Have you ever done this before?

934
01:40:44,760 --> 01:40:46,886
I don't know.

935
01:40:46,971 --> 01:40:48,930
Have you?

936
01:41:02,444 --> 01:41:04,737
I want to with you.

937
01:41:31,098 --> 01:41:33,308
I'm in love with you.

938
01:41:48,198 --> 01:41:50,491
I'm in love with you.

939
01:42:17,436 --> 01:42:19,354
Silencio.

940
01:42:20,898 --> 01:42:22,857
Silencio.

941
01:42:24,652 --> 01:42:26,945
Silencio.

942
01:42:28,113 --> 01:42:30,531
No hay banda.

943
01:42:31,825 --> 01:42:34,953
No hay banda.

944
01:42:35,037 --> 01:42:36,955
No hay orquesta.

945
01:42:39,541 --> 01:42:41,376
Silencio.

946
01:42:43,379 --> 01:42:45,296
Silencio.

947
01:42:45,381 --> 01:42:47,924
Silencio.

948
01:42:50,219 --> 01:42:52,470
Silencio.

949
01:42:53,847 --> 01:42:55,890
Silencio.

950
01:42:57,017 --> 01:43:00,311
- Rita? Rita?
- No hay banda.

951
01:43:00,396 --> 01:43:02,522
Rita, wake up.

952
01:43:04,525 --> 01:43:08,653
- No. No.
- It's okay. It's okay.

953
01:43:08,737 --> 01:43:10,655
No, it's not okay.

954
01:43:10,739 --> 01:43:12,991
What's wrong?

955
01:43:14,243 --> 01:43:16,869
Go with me somewhere.

956
01:43:19,206 --> 01:43:23,292
It's 2:00. It's 2:00 in the morning.

957
01:43:26,088 --> 01:43:28,047
Go with me somewhere.

958
01:43:29,508 --> 01:43:33,094
Sure. Now?

959
01:43:34,763 --> 01:43:37,515
Right now.

960
01:45:10,692 --> 01:45:14,779
No hay banda!

961
01:45:14,863 --> 01:45:18,157
There is no band!

962
01:45:18,242 --> 01:45:20,952
Il n'y a pas d'orchestre.

963
01:45:22,746 --> 01:45:25,456
This is all...

964
01:45:25,541 --> 01:45:27,875
a tape recording.

965
01:45:27,960 --> 01:45:31,796
No hay banda, and yet...

966
01:45:31,880 --> 01:45:33,381
we hear a band.

967
01:45:35,050 --> 01:45:38,010
If we want to hear a clarinet...

968
01:45:38,095 --> 01:45:40,847
listen.

969
01:45:46,186 --> 01:45:48,604
Une trombone en coulisse.

970
01:45:54,236 --> 01:45:56,404
Un trombón con sordina.

971
01:45:58,574 --> 01:46:03,578
J'aime le son d'une trombone en sourdine.

972
01:46:11,336 --> 01:46:14,797
A muted trumpet.

973
01:46:32,816 --> 01:46:35,443
It's all recorded.

974
01:46:38,280 --> 01:46:41,115
No hay banda!

975
01:46:42,618 --> 01:46:46,120
It is all... a tape.

976
01:46:56,048 --> 01:46:59,634
Il n'y a pas d'orchestre.

977
01:46:59,718 --> 01:47:02,261
It is...

978
01:47:02,346 --> 01:47:04,388
an illusion.

979
01:47:08,977 --> 01:47:10,811
Listen!

980
01:48:24,636 --> 01:48:26,846
Señoras y señores...

981
01:48:26,930 --> 01:48:30,850
el Club Silencio les presenta...

982
01:48:30,934 --> 01:48:33,644

983
01:48:33,729 --> 01:48:37,189

Betty?

1042
01:53:36,197 --> 01:53:38,657
¿Dónde estás?

1043
01:53:51,504 --> 01:53:53,464
Betty?

1044
01:55:59,007 --> 01:56:01,008
Hmm.

1045
01:56:22,280 --> 01:56:23,614
Hey, pretty girl.

1046
01:56:25,200 --> 01:56:27,201
Time to wake up.

1047
01:58:04,132 --> 01:58:07,718
- Where have you been?
- What do you want?

1048
01:58:07,802 --> 01:58:11,054
My lamp and dishes.

1049
01:58:12,515 --> 01:58:15,350
Come on, Diane. It's been three weeks.

1050
01:58:17,145 --> 01:58:20,606
I put your dishes in that box.

1051
01:58:40,919 --> 01:58:44,212
- That's my ashtray.
- Take it.

1052
01:58:55,183 --> 01:58:57,559
Anytime.

1053
01:58:57,644 --> 01:59:00,270
I'm just making sure, Diane.

1054
01:59:09,989 --> 01:59:11,531
This is it?

1055
01:59:11,616 --> 01:59:13,200
Yeah.

1056
01:59:17,664 --> 01:59:21,208
Oh, by the way, those two detectives
came by again looking for you.

1057
02:00:15,096 --> 02:00:17,222
Camilla.

1058
02:00:19,142 --> 02:00:21,601
You've come back.

1059
02:02:03,162 --> 02:02:06,289
What was that you were saying, beautiful?

1060
02:02:07,375 --> 02:02:09,668
I said...

1061
02:02:09,752 --> 02:02:11,753
"You drive me wild."

1062
02:02:24,934 --> 02:02:26,893
We shouldn't do this anymore.

1063
02:02:33,776 --> 02:02:35,735
Don't say that.

1064
02:02:40,908 --> 02:02:43,577
Don't ever say that.

1065
02:02:43,661 --> 02:02:45,996
Don't, Diane.

1066
02:02:46,080 --> 02:02:48,957
Stop it! Diane, stop!

1067
02:02:50,209 --> 02:02:52,586
I've tried to tell you this before.

1068
02:03:01,762 --> 02:03:04,055
It's him, isn't it?

1069
02:03:14,775 --> 02:03:17,819
Now, I'm not trying
to show you how to do the scene.

1070
02:03:17,904 --> 02:03:20,488
But just... watch me...

1071
02:03:20,573 --> 02:03:22,699
and I think you'll understand
what I'm getting at.

1072
02:03:22,783 --> 02:03:24,701
Hank.

1073
02:03:27,580 --> 02:03:29,915
Don't sit so... rigid.

1074
02:03:29,999 --> 02:03:32,709
Just – Just relax.

1075
02:03:32,793 --> 02:03:35,545
Now, the two of you are alone...

1076
02:03:35,630 --> 02:03:37,756
and it's real comfortable...

1077
02:03:39,300 --> 02:03:42,052
like you've known each other forever.

1078
02:03:42,136 --> 02:03:45,138
Even if you don't say anything,
it's-it's real comfortable.

1079
02:03:47,266 --> 02:03:49,184
Hank, can you just clear the set?

1080
02:03:49,268 --> 02:03:51,937
There's too many people around here.
Let us get this worked out.

1081
02:03:52,021 --> 02:03:54,522
Clear the set!
Clear the set, please!

1082
02:03:54,607 --> 02:03:56,650
Everyone have a cup of coffee.

1083
02:03:56,734 --> 02:04:00,153
- Everyone, please!
- Can Diane stay?

1084
02:04:00,238 --> 02:04:02,447
Yeah, sure. Diane can stay.

1085
02:04:02,531 --> 02:04:05,575
- Um, Hank, let Diane stay.
- Diane?

1086
02:04:11,874 --> 02:04:13,792
Now, when she starts to cry...

1087
02:04:13,876 --> 02:04:15,835
don't pull her towards you.

1088
02:04:17,505 --> 02:04:19,756
Let her fall into you.

1089
02:04:20,800 --> 02:04:22,759
Just let her fall.

1090
02:04:26,264 --> 02:04:28,223
Now, when you kiss her...

1091
02:04:29,684 --> 02:04:32,727
it's just a continuation of that move.

1092
02:04:34,563 --> 02:04:36,523
There's no break.

1093
02:05:02,550 --> 02:05:04,092
Kill the lights!

1094
02:05:13,894 --> 02:05:15,854
Don't be mad.

1095
02:05:15,938 --> 02:05:19,274
- Don't make it be like this.
- Oh, sure.

1096
02:05:19,358 --> 02:05:22,068
You want me to make this
easy for you? No.

1097
02:05:22,153 --> 02:05:25,238
No fucking way! It's not gonna be!

1098
02:05:25,323 --> 02:05:27,991
- It's not easy for me!
- Diane!

1099
02:06:52,201 --> 02:06:54,119
Hello, it's me.

1100
02:06:54,203 --> 02:06:56,329
Leave a message.

1101
02:06:58,374 --> 02:07:00,333
Diane?

1102
02:07:04,672 --> 02:07:07,549
- Hello?
- Diane?

1103
02:07:09,301 --> 02:07:13,430
- Camilla.
- Diane, the car's waiting.

1104
02:07:13,514 --> 02:07:15,473
Are you okay?

1105
02:07:15,558 --> 02:07:17,517
You coming?

1106
02:07:21,730 --> 02:07:25,108
- Uh-huh.
- Good.

1107
02:07:25,192 --> 02:07:27,110
It means so much to me.

1108
02:07:28,362 --> 02:07:30,989
Go on. The car's
right outside your house.

1109
02:07:32,199 --> 02:07:34,117
It's been waiting, okay?

1110
02:07:39,248 --> 02:07:41,124
Okay.

1111
02:07:41,208 --> 02:07:44,752
It's 6980 Mulholland Drive.

1112
02:07:46,213 --> 02:07:48,131
Mulholland Drive.

1113
02:08:57,826 --> 02:09:01,120
What are you doing?
We don't stop here.

1114
02:09:05,834 --> 02:09:08,253
A surprise.

1115
02:09:30,985 --> 02:09:32,944
Shortcut.

1116
02:09:35,281 --> 02:09:36,614
Come on, sweetheart.

1117
02:09:43,038 --> 02:09:45,248
It's beautiful.

1118
02:09:45,332 --> 02:09:47,208
A secret path.

1119
02:10:54,401 --> 02:10:56,402
Ah. Perfect timing.

1120
02:10:58,072 --> 02:11:00,031
Welcome, Diane.

1121
02:11:06,038 --> 02:11:07,538
Well...

1122
02:11:08,540 --> 02:11:10,583
here's to love.

1123
02:11:20,010 --> 02:11:21,511
Here's to love.

1124
02:11:26,934 --> 02:11:28,768
Ah, here she is.

1125
02:11:30,604 --> 02:11:32,522
Oh.

1126
02:11:38,320 --> 02:11:40,405
I don't believe you met my mother.

1127
02:11:41,949 --> 02:11:44,450
Hi. I'm Diane Selwyn.

1128
02:11:44,535 --> 02:11:47,203
Well, just call me Coco.
Everybody does.

1129
02:11:47,287 --> 02:11:49,706
Pleased to meet you.
Well, let's eat.

1130
02:11:49,790 --> 02:11:51,791
I'm starving.

1131
02:11:57,840 --> 02:12:00,133
I'm sorry I was late.

1132
02:12:19,820 --> 02:12:22,655
I'm from Deep River, Ontario.

1133
02:12:23,574 --> 02:12:25,450
A small town.

1134
02:12:25,534 --> 02:12:29,120
So you rolled in here from Canada.

1135
02:12:30,330 --> 02:12:32,665
I always wanted to come here.

1136
02:12:33,876 --> 02:12:36,586
I won this jitterbug contest.

1137
02:12:37,755 --> 02:12:39,672
That sort of led to acting.

1138
02:12:41,467 --> 02:12:44,010
You know, wanting to act.

1139
02:12:45,512 --> 02:12:47,513
When my aunt died –

1140
02:12:49,349 --> 02:12:52,935
Anyway, she – she left me some money.

1141
02:12:53,020 --> 02:12:55,688
- She worked here.
- In the movies?

1142
02:12:56,857 --> 02:12:58,524
Yes.

1143
02:12:59,526 --> 02:13:02,028
Well, how did you meet Camilla?

1144
02:13:03,697 --> 02:13:05,948
On The Sylvia North Story.

1145
02:13:06,033 --> 02:13:07,950
Oh, Camilla was great in that.

1146
02:13:19,922 --> 02:13:21,506
Yeah.

1147
02:13:23,217 --> 02:13:26,219
I wanted the lead so bad.

1148
02:13:27,471 --> 02:13:30,139
Anyway, Camilla got the part.

1149
02:13:33,560 --> 02:13:36,062
The director –

1150
02:13:36,146 --> 02:13:38,397
Bob Brooker?

1151
02:13:38,482 --> 02:13:40,066
Yes.

1152
02:13:42,653 --> 02:13:44,612
He didn't think so much of me.

1153
02:13:49,618 --> 02:13:52,703
Anyway, that's when we became friends.

1154
02:13:53,914 --> 02:13:55,832
She helped me...

1155
02:13:55,916 --> 02:13:59,418
getting some parts in some of her films.

1156
02:14:01,380 --> 02:14:02,922
I see.

1157
02:14:18,021 --> 02:14:20,731
So I got the pool...

1158
02:14:20,816 --> 02:14:22,859
and she got the pool man.

1159
02:14:22,943 --> 02:14:26,028
I couldn't believe it.

1160
02:14:26,113 --> 02:14:29,115
I wanted to buy that judge a Rolls-Royce.

1161
02:14:36,039 --> 02:14:37,957
Sometimes good things happen.

1162
02:15:32,054 --> 02:15:34,347
So I guess we've saved the best for last.

1163
02:15:37,351 --> 02:15:39,268
Do you wanna tell them?

1164
02:15:39,353 --> 02:15:41,270
No, y-you tell them.

1165
02:15:45,525 --> 02:15:47,443
Camilla and I ...

1166
02:16:00,040 --> 02:16:02,041
are going to be –

1167
02:16:13,929 --> 02:16:16,889
Sorry about that.

1168
02:16:23,271 --> 02:16:25,231
No, I'm fine.

1169
02:16:31,822 --> 02:16:33,656
This is the girl.

1170
02:16:35,409 --> 02:16:38,494
Don't show me this fuckin' thing here.

1171
02:16:38,578 --> 02:16:42,498
It's just an actress' photo resume.
Everybody's got one.

1172
02:16:43,917 --> 02:16:46,377
You got the money?

1173
02:16:46,461 --> 02:16:48,045
I sure do.

1174
02:16:59,599 --> 02:17:03,894
Okay, now, once you hand that over to me,
it's a done deal.

1175
02:17:06,815 --> 02:17:08,691
You sure you want this?

1176
02:17:14,448 --> 02:17:16,866
More than anything in this world.

1177
02:17:27,836 --> 02:17:31,130
When it's finished,
you'll find this where I told you.

1178
02:17:44,603 --> 02:17:46,520
What's it open?

1179
02:22:12,912 --> 02:22:15,289
Silencio.

1180
02:22:20,000 --> 02:22:25,000
